
This model of a scorpion was included in the classic DarkBASIC in an example called "room".

ScorpIdle_orig.x and ScorpWalk_orig.x are the original files from May 1999.

Both of these models work in DarkBASIC, but there are a few small flaws with this models:
1. The scorpion is too low. But need to increase its height, so that it stands on your plane floor.
2. Limb #1 (named mid03) is either a sting (not animated) or a coordinate marker. It is in the sky above the scorpion. It has to be hidden by the program code.

While ScorpIdle_orig.x works in DarkBASIC Professional, ScorpWalk_orig.x does not work, due to a bug in their engine.

ScorpIdle.x and ScorpWalk.x were converted (re-exported) using 3D Exploration 1.81 .

Additionally, following changes were done to address the problems mentioned above:
1. The coordinates of x3ds_mid02 (the whole scorpion) were corrected from y=-250 to y=0 (with a text editor)
2. The unnecessary limb #1 (mid03) was stripped.

ScorpIdle.x and ScorpWalk.x both work in DarkBASIC Professional, but they do not work in DarkBASIC anymore.

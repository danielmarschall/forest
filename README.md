Nighmare Forest is a game developed in the programming languages DarkBASIC Professional and Delphi. The development stated in 2001 and in 2025 I finally brought the game into Beta stage, after the development had paused several times.

## The Tale of the Nightmare Forest 
*They say there's a grove outside the village.*
*By day it's small, nothing more than a patch of trees.*

*But when night falls, it opens into a forest without end.*
*A few have gone in after dark. None came back.*

*The elders whisper the forest doesn't lose you - it keeps you.*
*And each soul it takes makes the grove a little larger by morning.*

*Today you've set up your tent below the trees,*
*waiting for nightfall... to see if the legend is true.*

## Known issues

- If you are playing in fullscreen mode, you MUST NOT minimize the game (e.g. using Alt+Tab), otherwise the game will crash once the window is restored. (This is a bug in the DarkBASIC compiler)
